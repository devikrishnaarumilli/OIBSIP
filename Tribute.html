          '80 Iconic Performances of Hindi Cinema', stating that "Sridevi's penchant for giggles and her ability to look distinctly tearful when required polishes these performances
           to perfection. Hell, she made Sunny Deol and Rajinikanth look like sidekicks in the film".The Times of India article 'Bollywood's Hit Double Roles' wrote, "Sridevi's
            performance had rocked the box office".Rediff featured the film in its countdown of "25 Best Double Roles in Bollywood" saying "What you don't realise until you have
             seen Chaalbaaz is just how incredible Sridevi is at depicting both ends of the spectrum",and that the film "cemented her position as an actress with a killer comic timing".
              Speaking to The Indian Express about Sridevi's act in ChaalBaaz, the director Pankaj Parashar said "She proved her range with the movie and after that she got lots of offers 
              which saw her in a double role".Her slapstick rain dance "Na Jaane Kahaan Se Aayi Hai" became successful with The Times of India describing it as "a Sridevi classic where she 
              simply looked wow with her chirpy expressions and rain drops kissing her cheeks."Sridevi garnered Best Actress nominations at Filmfare for both Chandni and ChaalBaaz in 1989, 
              winning for the latter.<br><br>
              ☛Chopra then cast Sridevi in his 1991 intergenerational musical romantic drama Lamhe. The Times of India included it in its list of 'Top 10 Films of Yash Chopra' describing it
               as a tale of "love transcending the boundaries of time and space" while Rediff called it "Quite easily one of his most definitive films, Chopra surpassed his own findings of 
               romance with the insightful, lovely Lamhe." Sridevi played both the roles of mother and daughter in what iDiva described as "another double role but it was unlike any played before.
               "Hailed by Rediff as "one of the most remarkable films of her career... often considered a film way ahead of its time", Sridevi's folk dance number 'Morni Baga Ma' also became a rage
                and was placed among the 'Top 5 Songs' of Yash Chopra by Hindustan Times.Lamhe was an underwhelming success at the box-office, but received widespread critical acclaim and has become
                 a cult classic over the years. Talking about the film, critic Rachel Dwyer wrote in her biography of the film-maker "Chopra's own favourite film, Lamhe (Moments (1991)), divided the 
                 audience on a class basis: it was hugely popular with metropolitan elites and the overseas market, which allowed it to break even, but it had a poor box-office response (largely 
                 lower-class, especially the repeat audience) because of its supposed incest theme".The Hindu reported that "With shades of incest, Lamhe caused more than a flutter and remained 
                 the talk of the town",while Sridevi herself admitted in an interview with Rajeev Masand that she found the subject "too bold".Though the film flopped at the box-office,
                  with Rediff describing its failure as "one of those bizarre, unexplained moments of cinema",Lamhe picked up 5 Filmfare trophies including Best Film and a second Best Actress 
                  trophy for Sridevi. Her popular Rajasthani costumes in the film also won designer Neeta Lulla her first National Film Award for Best Costume Design.<br><br>
                  ☛In 1992, Sridevi starred in the epic drama Khuda Gawah opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The actress played a double role again as an Afghan warrior Benazir and her daughter Mehndi. 
          Shot mostly in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan,it did good business with BBC reporting that "it ran to packed houses for 10 weeks in Kabul". Khuda Gawah still remains popular in 
          Afghanistan and Rediff reported that the film is "in great demand after the reopening of cinema halls in the country" in 2001. At Filmfare, the film picked up the Best Director
           trophy, while Sridevi earned a nomination for Best Actress. During the production of Jurassic Park in 1992–93, acclaimed Hollywood director and producer Steven Spielberg approached 
           Sridevi for a small role in the film. However, Sridevi, after evaluating the stature of the role, refused the offer. She was the highest-paid actress in India from 1985 to 1993.<br><br>
           ☛Sridevi's big-budget 1993 release Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja was one of India's most expensive films ever made. Though the film failed at the box office, Sridevi was appreciated with 
           Times of India calling her disguise in a comedy scene "the best ever South Indian role played by any actress".She next starred in the 1993 thriller Gumrah, opposite Sanjay Dutt. Directed
            by Mahesh Bhatt, the actress played a singer falsely accused of drugs smuggling in Hong Kong. Bollyspice stated in its 'Sridevi Retrospective' that "Despite great performances from the
             rest of the cast, Gumrah was really Sridevi's film. She managed to exemplify female emotion and robustness to a great degree that you remember the film largely for her significant 
             contribution towards it," Her performance earned her another nomination for Best Actress at Filmfare.<br><br>
             ☛In 1994, Sridevi teamed up with Anil Kapoor again in Laadla playing business tycoon Sheetal Jaitley. The character, described by Times of India as "rude, dominant and very competitive"
            brought her yet another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. She acted in her comeback film in Malayalam in 1996 – Bharathan's Devaraagam, a love story in which she starred opposite 
            Aravind Swamy.<br><br>
            ☛The last major film Sridevi starred in before she took a break from the industry was the romantic drama Judaai, released in 1997. Along with Anil Kapoor and Urmila Matondkar, the actress 
           played a greedy housewife going to extreme lengths for money. Talking about her swan-song, critic Subhash K. Jha wrote that Sridevi "left us with the most stunning hurrah in Judaai.
            A terrible film that I've watched countless times to see her play the money-minded harridan who 'sells' her husband to Urmila Matondkar. Who but Sridevi could carry of such an outrageous
             role with such enthusiastic élan?!"while Bollyspice stated that "She used her polished acting skills to illustrate her character’s greed and individualism at such a grotesque level.
             "Judaai earned Sridevi her eighth Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. In 1996, Sridevi married Boney Kapoor of the famed Bollywood royalty, the Kapoor family. During the years 1996–97,
              her mother was suffering from brain cancer-induced complications. After her mother's death in 1997, Sridevi went on a hiatus from the film industry.

           the way [...] Sridevi excels in fleshing out her character",and critic Subhash K. Jha said Sridevi "makes the contemporary actresses, even the coolest ones, look like jokes... 
           If you watch only 2 films every year make sure you see English Vinglish twice!"Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote Sridevi delivers "a performance that is nothing short of perfect [...] 
           It's warm and fuzzy, and leaves you with a big smile on your face."Sridevi doesn't miss a beat. Her performance is a triumph!", added the critic Anupama Chopra.Komal Nahta said she 
           "makes the best comeback in Bollywood history and delivers a landmark performance."<br><br>
           ☛With the high critical acclaim and massive commercial success of English Vinglish, Sridevi became the only actress in Bollywood to make a successful comeback as a leading lady after
            marriage and a long hiatus. Gauri Shinde featured her in the Financial Times 2012 list of '25 Indians To Watch'. She topped Rediff.com's annual listing of the "Bollywood's Best Actresses"
             in 2012; the website wrote English Vinglish "is a simple film where things are credible, never melodramatic" and Sridevi "always judges the tone right. It's the sort of performance younger

               of her daughter. Sridevi said that as a mother and an artiste, she empathized with her character's rage, and found it hard to be in a normal state during the filming.Mom was released on 
               7 July 2017 to highly positive reviews, with critics widely appreciating Sridevi's performance.The Times of India and The Indian Express added Sridevi "demonstrates why she is the
                high-priestess of Indian cinema" and that she "needs only a twitch or a glance to prove that she is a powerhouse and there are several scenes she lifts by just being there.
                "For her performance, Sridevi received the National Film Award for Best Actress and earned nominations for Best Actress and Best Actress (Critics) at Filmfare and the Screen Award for

                 ☛Sridevi campaigned for her father when he contested the Sivakasi constituency in 1989 assembly elections, but eventually lost in the elections.
                 Her father died in 1990 of heart attack, while she was shooting for Lamhe. Her mother died in 1996,as a result of the complications suffered from an operation that she underwent 
                 in 1995 on a brain tumor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The neurosurgeon operated on the wrong side of her brain destroying her vital tissues of vision 
                 and recent memory. This was widely reported in US media at that time which then led to a successful court battle and prompted then President Bill Clinton’s proposal of a program
                  for hospitals to disclose their medical malpractice[citation needed] and errors.<br><br>
                  ☛Sridevi was extremely discreet about her privacy and rarely gave interviews or discussed her private life in them. In 1996, she married producer Boney Kapoor. The couple had two daughters,

         Masand says; "I have never known anyone who was so painfully shy, so quiet off-screen, who just transformed into a force of nature when the cameras came on. She was an interviewer’s nightmare,
          but the movie-buff’s dream".Commenting on her reserved nature, Firstpost says; "Behind the glamorous heroine with twinkling, magical eyes and a stunning face, was an inherently shy woman, often
           mistaken as arrogant. The truth is she was shy. Having begun to act when she was just 4, she did not complete formal education or get much of a chance to interact with kids of her own age.
            Consequently, she developed a strong dislike for crowds and noise."
